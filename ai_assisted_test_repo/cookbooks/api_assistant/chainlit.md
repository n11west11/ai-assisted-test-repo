# API Assistant

This is a simple API assistant that uses the Langchain API tool to interact with the api. 

# Usage

Upload a OpenAPI v3.0 json file to the API Assistant and it will generate load the api tool for you to use in Chainlit. 
You may put a default api in default_api.json and it will load that api on startup.
